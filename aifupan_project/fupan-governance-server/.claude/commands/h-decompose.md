description: Decompose a PRD/EPIC into INVEST subtasks + scaffold per-subtask briefs + bind to launch_spec
argument-hint: <slug> <prd-path | --from-paste> [--input-type prd|epic] [--no-scaffold]
---

Pipeline that takes a monolithic PRD or EPIC and produces: (1) a structured `<date>_<slug>_tasks.md`, (2) per-subtask task_brief skeletons via `brief_from_decomposition.py`, (3) launch_spec rows linking everything. Without this command, the LLM has to remember to chain three steps and easily forgets the launch_spec binding.

## Step 1 — Parse `$ARGUMENTS`

Extract:
- `<slug>` (required, kebab-or-snake-case) — the EPIC/PRD identifier. STOP if missing.
- `<prd-path>` OR `--from-paste` (required, mutually exclusive).
  - File path: must exist, must be a readable `.md` or `.txt`.
  - `--from-paste`: invoke `AskUserQuestion` asking user to paste the PRD/EPIC content in the next message; write it to `.claude/runs/decompositions/<date>_<slug>_input.md` before continuing.
- `--input-type prd|epic` (optional). If omitted, infer:
  - Multi-section markdown with explicit "Requirements" / "User Stories" / "需求列表" headings → PRD
  - Single coherent feature description without enumerated requirements → EPIC
- `--no-scaffold` (optional): produce only the `_tasks.md`, skip `brief_from_decomposition.py` and launch_spec binding.

If `.claude/runs/task-briefs/*_<slug>_*.md` already exists → STOP and report collision. Pick a new slug or remove the prior artifacts explicitly.

## Step 2 — Pre-decomposition validation (mandatory, per task-decomposition-guide §0)

Branch on input-type:

**PRD path** — invoke `product-manager-expert` skill Mode A (Ingestion) on the input.
- Read its output: validated requirement list, conflicts flagged (if any).
- CRITICAL conflicts present → invoke `AskUserQuestion` block below; do NOT default to STOP.

**Conflict triage** AskUserQuestion (fires only when `product-manager-expert` returns `[Conflicts]` with severity=CRITICAL):

Mode A — `[Conflicts]` field IS structured (one conflict per line with id):

```
Q: <N> CRITICAL conflict(s) detected by product-manager-expert. Select per-conflict action (multiSelect):
- conflict-<id-1>: <one-line summary>
    Subscribe options: defer (annotate [Dep-Risk]) | fix-now (block decomposition) | skip-subtask (drop affected requirement)
- conflict-<id-2>: <one-line summary>
- ...
```

Use one AskUserQuestion with multiSelect for action; loop per conflict if > 4 (Claude Code limit). All conflicts must be resolved before continuing.

Mode B — `[Conflicts]` field is unstructured prose (degraded fallback):

```
Q: Conflicts detected but not individually addressable. How to proceed?
- Abort (recommended) — STOP /h-decompose; user resolves conflicts in PRD source first
- Proceed anyway — surface conflicts in [Dep-Risk Flags] of final report; decompose with embedded ambiguity
```

**EPIC path** — invoke `adversarial-review` skill with Category C, EPIC frame:
> "Assume the task decomposition has a hidden sequential dependency that makes parallel execution impossible. Which two tasks, and what shared state forces the ordering?"
- CRITICAL → resolve before decomposing.
- MINOR → continue; annotate affected subtasks with `[Dep-Risk]` in Step 3 output.

One round only.

## Step 3 — Invoke task-decomposition-guide skill

Call the skill explicitly with the validated input. The skill enforces INVEST and Vertical Slicing.

Required output file: `.claude/runs/task-briefs/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<slug>_tasks.md` (use today's date).

`_tasks.md` per-subtask format (per task-decomposition-guide §1.5 + §4):

| Field | MUST contain |
|---|---|
| `Type` | `Change` OR `Research` (drives downstream routing) |
| `Subtype` | Change: `Vertical Slice` / `Technical Chore` / `Migration`; Research: `quick` / `deep` |
| `Effort` | Change: `Simple` / `Medium` / `Complex`; Research: `quick` / `deep` |
| `Dependencies` | other subtask IDs or `None` |
| `Acceptance Criteria` | `- [ ] <text>` checkbox list; Change uses Given/When/Then; Research uses §1 Question + quota |
| `Handoff Artifact` | Change: `task_brief.md` or intermediate spec; Research: `research_report.md` |

If `brief_from_decomposition.py --tasks <file>` rejects the format, revise once, then STOP.

## Step 4 — INVEST quality gate (inline self-check)

Before scaffolding briefs, audit each subtask in the `_tasks.md`:

| Letter | Check |
|---|---|
| **I**ndependent | Does any subtask have >2 `Dependencies`? → flag for re-slice |
| **N**egotiable | Does the task description prescribe implementation (`how`)? → rewrite as `what + why` |
| **V**aluable | Can you state the business or technical outcome in one sentence? |
| **E**stimable | Is `Effort` filled with `Simple`/`Medium`/`Complex`? Missing → reject |
| **S**mall | Any `Complex` task with >15 file impact? → recommend further slicing |
| **T**estable | Each subtask has ≥1 AC checkbox? Missing → reject |

If any reject criterion fires, revise the `_tasks.md` once. Second revision-required signal → STOP and ask user.

## Step 5 — Scaffold per-subtask artifacts (skip if `--no-scaffold`)

Split by Type:

| Type | Scaffold action |
|---|---|
| Change | `brief_from_decomposition.py --tasks <file>` → writes `task-briefs/<slug>_part_<i>_task_brief.md` |
| Research | Skip script. Main agent inline-writes `reports/<date>_<slug>_part_<i>_research.md` with RESEARCH frontmatter + 7-section TODO skeleton (mirrors the report scaffold step from the research entry command) |

Both branches: substantive content stays placeholder; filled at each subtask's own Propose / R1 phase.

If `brief_from_decomposition.py` exits non-zero on Change subtasks → surface stderr verbatim and STOP. Do not bind partial scaffolds to launch_spec.

## Step 6 — Bind all subtasks to launch_spec

For each scaffolded artifact from Step 5:

Resolve or create the latest `.claude/runs/launch-specs/launch_spec_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` (latest if exists, else create with table header).

**Risk literal by Type:**

| Type | Rule |
|---|---|
| Research | `RES` literal; Phase = `Research`; bypass Change-side risk inference |
| Change | apply two-stage rule below |

**Change two-stage risk inference (Effort is SIZE proxy, not RISK proxy):**

1. Size baseline from Effort: `Simple → LOW`, `Medium → MEDIUM`, `Complex → MEDIUM`. Do NOT auto-promote Complex to HIGH; a large mechanical refactor is MEDIUM.
2. Keyword upgrade to HIGH: scan `Goal` + `Acceptance Criteria` for any HIGH-tier keyword from `lifecycle.md` Risk Classification — `auth`, mutating DDL (`ALTER` / `DROP` / `MODIFY` / `RENAME` / `migration`), public API breaking change, payment / financial logic, `secret` / `token` / `credential`, error code definition, lifecycle / policy / routing files. Match → HIGH.
3. Hard floor: `Depends On` includes a HIGH upstream subtask → at minimum MEDIUM.

**Row format per Type:**

```
| <slug>_part_<i> | <LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH> | Propose  | PENDING | <deps or "none"> | <brief path>  |   # Change
| <slug>_part_<i> | RES                | Research | PENDING | <deps or "none"> | <report path> |   # Research
```

All rows start `PENDING`. Dependencies form a DAG — cycle detected → STOP, fix at Step 3 decomposition layer (NOT by editing launch_spec rows).

## Step 7 — Report

Output exactly this block:

```
[Decompose Status]: COMPLETE | PARTIAL | FAILED
[Slug]: <slug>
[Input Type]: prd | epic
[Subtasks]: <N>
[Tasks File]: .claude/runs/task-briefs/<date>_<slug>_tasks.md
[Briefs Scaffolded]: <list of part_<i> paths, or "skipped (--no-scaffold)">
[Launch Spec]: <path> (rows appended: <N>)
[Dependency Graph]:
  part_1 → (none)
  part_2 → part_1
  part_3 → part_1
  ...
[Parallelizable Now]: <list of subtasks with no unmet deps>
[Dep-Risk Flags]: <list from Step 2, or "none">
[Next Action]: Run /h-resume to enter <first-parallelizable-part-slug>. For parallel work on multiple parts, flip the next part's launch_spec row from PENDING to IN_PROGRESS first, then re-run /h-resume.
```

## Hard constraints

- **Allowed edits**: `.claude/runs/decompositions/*` (for paste input), `.claude/runs/task-briefs/<date>_<slug>_tasks.md`, scaffolded brief skeletons, and the target `launch_spec_*.md`. Nothing else.
- **No source-code edits** — decomposition is planning, not implementation.
- **Pre-decomposition validation is non-skippable** (Step 2). Skipping it embeds hidden conflicts/dependencies into the task graph — the entire reason `task-decomposition-guide` mandates §0.
- **Refuse to bind partial scaffolds** to launch_spec — all-or-nothing in Step 6 to keep the DAG consistent.
- **Cycle detection in Step 6 is mandatory** — a cyclic launch_spec is worse than no launch_spec.
- Anti-loop: max 1 revision per step (decomposition, INVEST audit, scaffold). Second failure → STOP and ask user.

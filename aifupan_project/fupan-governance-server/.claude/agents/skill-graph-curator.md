# Skill Graph Curator

You maintain the skill index so that all skills are discoverable and correctly described. Your scope: `.claude/skills/skill-index/SKILL.md` and the `.claude/skills/` directory. Use the Skill tool on demand for: skill-graph-manager, skill-creator.

## Inline skill vs this agent

`skill-graph-manager` SKILL (inline): triggered when a single skill's metadata changes during implementation — runs in the main agent's context as a quick lint pass.
`skill-graph-curator` AGENT (this file): dispatched at Archive when ≥1 skill was created/modified — isolated context, writes to skill-index, runs the full consistency check.

Rule: if only reading/linting → inline skill. If writing to skill-index → dispatch this agent.

## When to Act

- Archive phase of STANDARD tasks where skills were created or modified
- When the user asks to "update the skill index"
- After importing external skills

## Process

### 1. Identify skill changes
Compare the current skill directory listing against the skill index:
```bash
ls -d .claude/skills/*/  | xargs -I{} basename {} | sort
```
Check if each directory has a `SKILL.md` and whether it's listed in the index.

### 2. For new skills
- Read the skill's `SKILL.md` to extract its name and description
- Add an entry to `.claude/skills/skill-index/SKILL.md` with:
  - Skill name (from the directory name)
  - One-line description (from the SKILL.md description field)
  - Path to the skill file

### 3. For changed skills
- If a skill's description or name changed, update the index entry
- If a skill was deleted, remove its entry from the index

### 4. Consistency check
```bash
python3 .claude/scripts/gates/skill_index_linter.py --index .claude/skills/skill-index/SKILL.md --skills-dir .claude/skills
```

This checks:
- Every skill directory has a corresponding SKILL.md
- Every SKILL.md is referenced in the skill index
- No dead links to non-existent skills
- No duplicate entries

## Decision Matrix

| Finding | Action |
|---|---|
| Skill dir exists but not in index | Add to index |
| Skill in index but dir missing | Remove from index |
| Skill renamed | Update index entry |
| Skill description changed | Update index entry |
| Duplicate entries | Keep the more accurate one, remove the other |

## Gate

```bash
python3 .claude/scripts/gates/skill_index_linter.py --index .claude/skills/skill-index/SKILL.md --skills-dir .claude/skills
```

WARN is acceptable (note it and proceed). FAIL blocks yield — fix and re-run.
